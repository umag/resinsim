# ADR-0020: Tier-2 spatial thermal diffusion as the canonical voxel-mode thermal path

## Status
Accepted (Phase 3 of issue `t2f4-thermal-diffusion`, 2026-05-21).

## Context

The Tier-1 lumped-capacitance thermal model (ADR-0007, KB-152) tracks
two coupled scalars: an LED-case temperature time-series fitted to
Mars 5 Ultra telemetry, and a vat temperature derived via a dimensionless
`led_to_vat_coupling` factor. ADR-0007 §"Alternatives considered (b)"
explicitly scoped full spatial diffusion to Tier-2 as a deliberate
deferral.

Phase 4 of `projects/000-global/research/resinsim-physics-simulation-plan.md`
schedules four Tier-2 voxel-field deliverables. As of 2026-05-20 the
prior three have shipped:

- ADR-0017 — `CureField` + `PhotoinitiatorField` (`t2f1`)
- ADR-0018 — `StrainField` + `StressField` (`t2f3`)
- ADR-0019 — RSFIELD sidecar binary format (`t2f3.5`)

This work (`t2f4-thermal-diffusion`) lands the fourth: a 3D temperature
field that supersedes the Tier-1 vat scalar for downstream consumers
(per-voxel `Ec(T)` Arrhenius cure correction, lazy per-voxel viscosity).
The paused issue `vat-temp-fan-curves` ("Tier-1 vat plateau under-
predicts reality") is its proximate motivator.

External literature surveyed during planning (Procedia CIRP 2022 on
in-situ thermography + FE simulation for VPP; Polymers 2020 / PMC7284352
on photo-DSC heat of polymerization ~260-570 J/g for acrylates; ADI
heat-equation literature including Peaceman & Rachford 1955) shaped the
scheme choice and the deferred follow-ons listed below.

## Decision

### (i) Explicit FTCS with CFL guard; ADI documented as CPU fallback

Forward-time centred-space (FTCS) finite-difference stencil:

```
T_new[i,j,k] = T_old[i,j,k] + dt · α · (
    (T[i+1,j,k] − 2 T[i,j,k] + T[i−1,j,k]) / dx²
  + (T[i,j+1,k] − 2 T[i,j,k] + T[i,j−1,k]) / dy²
  + (T[i,j,k+1] − 2 T[i,j,k] + T[i,j,k−1]) / dz²
)
```

CFL guard: `dt_max = 0.5 · min(dx², dy², dz²) / (3 · α)`. Substeps per
layer cap at 1000; exceeding raises `CflBudgetExceeded` with a hint
pointing to the ADI fallback documented under "Numerical scheme choice"
in §Alternatives below.

Rationale for FTCS over ADI:
- **Forward-compat with t2f5 GPU acceleration.** Explicit stencils are
  trivially GPU-portable (one kernel per substep, no thread
  dependencies). ADI's tridiagonal solves have sequential
  dependencies along each line — GPU-painful. Picking ADI now would
  create a rewrite at t2f5.
- **Simpler first landing.** No tridiagonal solver, no BC matrix
  assembly.
- **Performance budget fits.** Back-of-envelope for Mars 5 Ultra
  (16 M voxels, ~30 substeps/layer, 200 layers, ~7 FLOPS/voxel): ~28 s
  on CPU single-thread. Inside the "seconds-minutes" Tier-2 budget.

### (ii) Full vat envelope (NOT part bbox)

`ThermalField` spans the full vat volume, anchored to
`PrinterProfile.build_envelope_mm`. The other Tier-2 voxel fields
(`CureField`, `StrainField`, `StressField`) remain part-bbox anchored.
The aggregate invariant evolves from "all fields share one bbox" to
"each field has its own self-consistent bbox + `voxel_size_mm`; thermal
matches the printer envelope; the rest match the part bbox".

Rationale: the diffusion solve needs the wall + resin surface boundary
condition zones. Cropping to the part bbox removes the BC anchors,
leaving the solve with synthetic boundaries that mean nothing physical.

### (iii) Z axis is spatial mm (NOT layer index)

`ThermalField`'s Z axis represents vat-envelope height in mm divided
by `voxel_size_mm`. Field is mutated in-place every solver substep —
no `write_layer` write-once semantic like `StrainField`'s
`lock_strain_at`.

This intentionally departs from the
`docs/patterns/voxel-field-z-dimension-is-layer-count.md` pattern that
governs the other Tier-2 voxel fields. The new pattern
`docs/patterns/thermal-field-z-dim-is-spatial.md` documents the
deviation. Temperature is a continuous spatio-temporal field; layer-
count Z is the wrong abstraction.

### (iv) Single resin-domain α (vat walls handled as convective BC; cured polymer treated as resin)

The diffusion domain physically spans liquid resin (α ≈ 1.07e-7 m²/s),
cured polymer (slightly higher k; α ≈ 1.2-1.5× resin), FEP film at the
bottom (~9e-8 m²/s), and the Al vat wall (~8.4e-5 m²/s, 800× resin).
A faithful multi-region α would force `dt_max` through `α_max` to
~3 µs — millions of substeps per layer. Catastrophic.

v1 ships with a SINGLE scalar α = liquid resin's thermal diffusivity.
The vat wall is modelled exclusively as a convective boundary condition
with lumped resistance `1/h_eff = 1/h_air + wall_thickness/wall_k`.
Cured polymer inside the field is treated as resin — the approximation
introduces a ~30% local α error in the inner part region but the
cured-polymer region is shielded from the high-flux BC zones so the
downstream impact is small.

Multi-region α heterogeneity is filed as the `t2f4b` follow-on (see
§Follow-ons).

### (v) Parallel per-voxel update via Rayon (still deterministic)

The solver's inner FTCS stencil is parallelised across voxels using
Rayon (`ndarray::Zip::par_for_each`). **Bit-identical** output is still
guaranteed:

- Each voxel reads only from the immutable `t_old` snapshot and writes
  ONLY to its own `(ix, iy, iz)` cell — no cross-thread writes, no
  parallel reduction.
- Each cell's final value is a deterministic function of `t_old`
  neighbours; thread schedule cannot reorder operations within a single
  voxel's computation.
- Therefore the final `thermal_field` bytes are bit-identical
  run-to-run, preserving the sidecar sha256 invariant.

The associative-float hazard only applies to **reductions** like
`volume_mean_c` and `volume_max_c` — these are READ-ONLY reports
(used by the run-end summary stderr line) and do NOT enter the field's
persistent state. Reductions stay serial.

Snapshot allocation is amortised via a caller-owned scratch buffer
(`Array3<f32>` allocated once per `VoxelState`, reused for every
`step()` call) — avoiding the per-substep `Array3::clone()` that
was the dominant cost at Mars-class envelopes + 0.5 mm voxels.

Further parallelism (GPU compute kernels for the same stencil) is
filed under `t2f5-gpu-acceleration-wgpu`.

### (vi) Tier-1 stays as LED-case BC source, routed via LayerTimingCalculator

The Dirichlet bottom BC at the LCD/FEP interface is computed from
Tier-1's `ThermalCalculator::led_case_temperature_at(t_layer_end, …)`
where `t_layer_end = LayerTimingCalculator::cumulative_times_sec(recipe,
printer, n)`. The latter honours the ADR-0007 Linear-vs-Tilt
release-mechanism distinction — critical for Mars 5 Ultra (Tilt) whose
canonical per-layer release duration is `lift_cycle_sec`, not
`lift_distance/lift_speed`.

Pattern: `docs/patterns/tier1-as-bc-source-for-tier2.md`.

When Tier-2 is active, downstream consumers (cure, viscosity) bypass
Tier-1 Stage B (`vat_temperature_at_layer_v2`) and read per-voxel
temperature from `ThermalField`. Tier-1 Stage A survives as the LED-case
source only.

### (vii) No scalar/field dispatch fallback under field-sim

Under the `field-sim` Cargo feature, `ThermalField` is unconditional
on the aggregate (not `Option<ThermalField>`) and
`VoxelCureCalculator::ec_at_temp` is REPLACED by `ec_at_temp_field`
(not a sibling — the scalar wrapper at `voxel_cure_calculator.rs:284`
is deleted, callers migrate). The Tier-1 cure path
(`CureCalculator::ec_at_temp` taking a scalar `VatTemperature`) remains
for default-feature builds and as the underlying single-source Arrhenius
helper.

Auto-activation: setting `--voxel-cure-mm` (which engages the voxel
cure path) automatically engages Tier-2 thermal. The two are physically
coupled — per-voxel `Ec(T)` correction needs per-voxel `T`. No separate
`--thermal-diffusion-mm` CLI flag.

### (viii) Explicit scope cuts (filed as follow-ons)

v1 deliberately ships WITHOUT:

- **Exothermic source term Q ∝ Δcure × ΔH.** Heat-of-polymerization for
  acrylates is ~260-570 J/g (PMC7284352 photo-DSC), enough to raise a
  fully-curing voxel by ~250 K adiabatically. The cure → thermal
  dispatch ordering in `SimulationRunner::apply_voxel_*_for_layer`
  preserves Δdose availability for a follow-on. Filed as `t2f4c`.
- **Stored `ViscosityField` value object.** Viscosity is computed
  lazily from `ThermalField + ResinProfile` via the new
  `viscosity_at_temp_field` accessor. No stored VO in v1. Filed as
  `t2f4d`.
- **Multi-region α heterogeneity** (see §Decision iv). Filed as `t2f4b`.
- **ADI solver as CPU fallback.** Documented under §Alternatives but
  unimplemented. Filed alongside `CflBudgetExceeded`'s hint.
- **GPU parallelisation.** Filed as `t2f5-gpu-acceleration-wgpu`
  (already in the Phase-4 plan).
- **Vat-thermistor telemetry collection on Mars 5 Ultra.** No vat-side
  ground truth exists in `data/elegoo/`. BME280 + thermocouple proposal
  filed at harvest.
- **Sub-substep BC interpolation.** v1 holds LED-case BC constant across
  inner CFL substeps of a layer. Filed alongside the
  `tier1-as-bc-source-for-tier2` pattern.
- **Exposure-on/off thermal phases.** v1 evolves diffusion for the full
  `layer_time`; a finer model would split into exposure-on (LED
  active) and exposure-off (lift cycle). Filed at harvest.

### (ix) Single-PR landing accepted

This ships 2 new ADR/KB files + 3 new pattern docs + 1 new VO + 6 new
typed-boundary VOs + 1 new domain service + 1 sidecar variant + format
version bump + match-arm updates + 2 UAT scenarios + 1 calibration
integration test + 7 in-repo TOML migrations.

Per project memory `feedback_memory_tradeoffs.md` (simple-first over
splitting into coupled sub-PRs) and the ADR-0017 single-PR-landing
precedent, this is accepted as a single PR. Migration is mechanical
(no public-API rewrites like t2f1's `cure_depth_um → cure_depth_um_summary`
37-file sweep); thermal field is purely additive under `field-sim`.

### (x) RSFIELD_FORMAT_VERSION bumped 1 → 2 (clean break)

The sidecar `RSFIELD_FORMAT_VERSION` constant bumps from 1 to 2.
Decoders reject v1 sidecars with the existing typed `UnknownFormatVersion`
error path — no v1 read path retained, no compat shim. This is consistent
with the "don't care about legacy" lifecycle direction.

Safe because no `.fields.bin` files are checked into the repository
(verified by `find` audit). Existing tests (`sidecar_roundtrip_integration.rs`,
`sidecar_security_integration.rs`) generate fixtures at test-time; their
generators update to v2 in lockstep with the constant bump.

`MAX_FIELD_COUNT = 16` ceiling: `Thermal` is the 5th defined `FieldKind`;
11 slots remain.

## Alternatives considered

**(a) Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI), e.g. Peaceman-Rachford.**
Unconditionally stable for the heat equation; full layer-time `dt`
allowed; tridiagonal solves per dimension. The standard choice in
mature heat-equation literature. **Rejected for v1** because the
tridiagonal solves have sequential dependencies along each line, making
the t2f5 GPU port a rewrite rather than a port. Filed as the CPU-fallback
follow-on if FTCS substep counts blow the 1000 cap; the
`CflBudgetExceeded::hint` field points here.

**(b) Finite-element methods (FEM) as in commercial COMSOL VPP
workflows** (e.g. Procedia CIRP 2022 in-situ thermography paper). High
fidelity for geometric BCs but heavy implementation; no per-voxel
storage match with `CureField` / `StrainField`. **Rejected** for v1 —
massive scope, no clear consumer beyond a single calibration test.

**(c) Reaction-diffusion coupled solver with photoinitiator depletion + heat
source from cure** (newer VPP literature). Couples this work with t2f4c
exothermic Q + t2f1's existing photoinitiator depletion. **Rejected for
v1** as scope creep; preserved as the t2f4c follow-on. Cure→thermal
dispatch order in `SimulationRunner` preserves the option.

**(d) Multi-region α field from the outset.** See §Decision iv. The
α_max-driven CFL would push to microsecond substeps, blowing the budget.

**(e) Layer-count Z + per-layer snapshot history.** See §Decision iii.
Turns 3D × time into 4D storage; N× memory; obscures the natural domain.

## Consequences

- **`PrintSimulation.thermal_field: ThermalField`** added unconditionally
  under `field-sim` (gate at module level — the type doesn't exist in
  default builds). Default-feature builds untouched.
- **`PrinterProfile.build_envelope_mm` and the 7 new thermal material
  fields are required under `field-sim`** at `validate()` time. The 7
  in-repo profile TOMLs are migrated in lockstep with the code change.
  Implementation pattern: keep the fields as `Option<T>` on the struct
  + `#[serde(default)]` so cross-feature TOML interchange holds; reject
  `None` at `validate()` only when `cfg(feature = "field-sim")` is on.
- **Cargo feature matrix (4 configs)** per
  `agent-constraints/implementation-conventions.md` must stay clean
  before code review.
- **Sidecar v1 sidecars on disk become unreadable.** Acceptable per
  §Decision x and the "don't care about legacy" direction.
- **The paused `vat-temp-fan-curves` issue is superseded by this work**
  and closes cleanly post-merge (`swamp model method run vat-temp-fan-curves
  close --input close_reason="superseded-by-t2f4-thermal-diffusion"`).
  The "needs vat-thermistor data" caveat lives in the t2f4 harvest
  follow-on, not in the close note.

## Cold-start convention

`ThermalField` initialises to uniform `T_ambient` at layer 0. The first
hundreds of layers' diffusion wave from the LED-case BC IS the warm-up.
Visible in `resinsim-viz` heatmaps as a long cold tail in the early
print; documented here so a reviewer doesn't read the convention as a
bug. This matches the physical reality (a Mars 5 Ultra started from
ambient does take ~3 τ ≈ 3-4 h to reach steady state per KB-152's
`led_tau_sec = 4000 s`).
